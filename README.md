# COMP3231 Operating System Assignments

This repo showcases the work done on the [OS161](http://www.os161.org/) learning operating systems divided into 3 projects. 
 
# Project 1: Concurrency & Synchronisation 

This project involved synchronising a mock CD_ROM, using synch primitives such as locks, semaphores
and condition varaibles.

# Project 2: Virtual File System

This project involved writing the system call operations for a virtual file system and doing the overhead
booking keeping of per process open file tables and file descriptors. 

# Project 3: Virtual Memory

This project involved create virtual memory and mainting book keeping for regions and translations from 
physical frames to virtual pages. An emulated TLB based on MIPS architecture was used.
